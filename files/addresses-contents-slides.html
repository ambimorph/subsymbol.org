 Addresses and Contents
========================

What are we naming?
===================

* Protagonist seeks to replace naming from a hierarchy-based system, to a category-based system.
* Fundamental issue: 

  **We conflate addresses with contents when naming things.**

* Which do we want to name?

Citations
=========

* Citations of books or research papers are to *contents*.

  * They have content-based IDs, such as ISBNs.

* URLs are *addresses*.

  * If you want to cite them in your research, they need to have timestamps to guarantee uniqueness.

Pointers
========

* Many of you have probably had a bug once confusing a pointer with its value.

Tahoe-LAFS
==========

* Immutable files: the reference to the file is content based for integrity and deduplication.
* Mutable files: the reference to the file specifies a "slot".

Protagonist
===========

* Tags should be applicable to addresses (inodes) or contents (by hash)
* Since system calls operate on path names, results should be in paths in either case.
