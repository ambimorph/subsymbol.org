<html><body><div class="document" id="literally-ironic-semantic-shifts-are-ironically-very-typical">   <p>I recently saw a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.npr.org/2014/04/23/306238447/new-browser-plug-in-would-literally-annihilate-this-headline">story about a whimsical browser plug-in written by Mike Lazer-Walker</a>(incidentally, a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.hackerschool.com/blog/30-words-are-hard">Hacker Schooler</a>), that substitutes all occurrences of the word 'literally' with the word 'figuratively'. I posted it with (almost) no comment on Facebook, to which the only response was from a Waterloo friend, who actually found the substitution annoying, because, he argued, 'figuratively' is not what is usually meant.</p><p>Of course, he is right about that. 'Literally', like 'very', 'really', 'truly', and in some cases 'actually' <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id3" id="id1">[1]</a>, share a common semantic shift. They all originally meant something like 'do not take the following as exaggeration or metaphor' (insofar as any language use can be non-metaphorical), and have all become intensifiers. This is, of course, somewhat ironic (in the situational sense of 'ironic', which is neither the literary sense, nor the emerging sense of 'not what I wanted' <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id4" id="id2">[2]</a>).</p><p>I don't cringe when I hear 'very', except insofar as it is often vacuous. That I do cringe on hearing 'literally' used as an intensifier is probably because, unlike 'very', the current use which is very <a class="reference external" href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=very">old</a>, this meaning of 'literally' emerged in my adulthood, and so it sounds unnatural to me. When wearing my linguist hat, I like to embrace diversity and change, rather than taking the stance that my dialect is 'correct'. The strongest stance I can fairly take is that in <em>my</em> dialect, the new meaning is unacceptable, or that using this meaning has certain social implications about the speaker.</p><p>But rather than taking the plug-in to be suggesting an actual solution, I take it in the spirit of Mark Twain's advice: 'Substitute 'damn' every time you're inclined to write 'very;' your editor will delete it and the writing will be just as it should be.' Once the reader or writer sees 'figuratively', the appropriate transformation should be more readily obvious.</p><p>More likely, it is simply an elaborate joke made by a clever person while exploring how to write plug-ins. In any case, I liked the idea, both for its wit, and for the other fun linguistics ideas it points to, including, for example, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gizoogle.net/tranzizzle.php?search=www.subsymbol.org&amp;se=Go+Git+Dis+Shiznit">tranzizzle</a> (hat tip to <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gizoogle.net/tranzizzle.php?search=www.cs.cmu.edu%2F~nasmith&amp;se=Go+Git+Dis+Shiznit">Noah Smizzle</a>).</p><p>The question I am left with is, given this development, what word do I use <em>now</em> if I want the literal meaning of literal?</p><table class="docutils footnote" frame="void" id="id3" rules="none"><colgroup><col class="label"><col></colgroup><tbody valign="top"><tr><td class="label"><a class="fn-backref" href="#id1">[1]</a></td><td>'Actually' is often used to make a contrast.</td></tr></tbody></table><table class="docutils footnote" frame="void" id="id4" rules="none"><colgroup><col class="label"><col></colgroup><tbody valign="top"><tr><td class="label"><a class="fn-backref" href="#id2">[2]</a></td><td>See this comic: <a class="reference external" href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/irony">http://theoatmeal.com/comics/irony</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></body></html>
