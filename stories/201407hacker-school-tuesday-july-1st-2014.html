<html><body><div class="document" id="hacker-school-tuesday-july-1st-2014">   <p>On Tuesday I made some progress toward the Protagonist repair functionality.</p><p>I also started porting off of Blogger so I can have more control over content here, including getting these blog posts out of your stream, if you are subscribed for my posts, but don't want my logs.</p><div class="section" id="plan"><h3>Plan</h3><div class="section" id="protagonist"><h4>Protagonist</h4><ul><li><p class="first">Begin implementing repair: a script to make sure that files in the tagsystem still match the filesystem they map to. The intended use is somewhat like the way in unix <cite>locate</cite> relies on  <cite>mlocate</cite> to regularly run <cite>updatedb</cite> to index all files.</p><p>The repair function should do three things:</p><ul class="simple"><li>Find files that are in truenames but not tagged with any tags, and remove them.</li><li>Find tagged files that have been moved on the original system, and update their truenames entry.</li><li>Find tagged files that have been removed from the filesystem, and free the space by releasing the hard links.</li></ul></li></ul></div><div class="section" id="blogging"><h4>Blogging</h4><ul class="simple"><li>Start porting subsymbol.org to Nikola, so that I can have better control over the structure of the site. In particular, I want to let logging posts like these accumulate in the background, while keeping the front page clean and more professional.</li></ul></div></div><div class="section" id="actual"><h3>Actual</h3><div class="section" id="id1"><h4>Protagonist</h4><ul class="simple"><li>Wrote a function that finds all places in the tagsystem where a given file is tagged. This will be used to discover when a file has no more tags and can therefore be removed from the truenames index. It can be run by the repairer, but it can also be run whenever a file is untagged, to check for the case that there are no more tags on the file.</li><li>Put this function into <cite>untag</cite> as just described.</li></ul></div><div class="section" id="id2"><h4>Blogging</h4><ul class="simple"><li>Looked at the Nikola docs, tried out the demo, and figured out how to port subsymbol using the import_blogger plugin.<ul><li>This was really straightforward and easy.  Before I can complete it, though, I need to do two things:<ul><li>Rearrange the imported sections a little to reflect that I want a site, not a blog.</li><li>Get new hosting set up, which I'm not really sure how to do.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div></div></div></body></html>
