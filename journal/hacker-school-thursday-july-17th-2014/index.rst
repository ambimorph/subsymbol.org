After Hacker School on Thursday, I immediately went to meet Zooko and our eldest son who were in town for HOPE X.
I took no time out to write my journal post, and prioritised seeing them all weekend.
This was wonderful, but it does mean that my memory for Thursday is less clear than typical.

I worked on Protagonist most or all of the day.  Because I had run into design problems the previous day, I stepped back farther than test-first design into document-first design, by changing the README.  This is where I intend to pick up again today, although, with the new batch of HaSchers in, anything could happen.
