<html><body><div class="document" id="hacker-school-wednesday-july-2nd-2014">   <p>I hope this will be my last post to subsymbol.org before I finish the moving and restructuring.</p><p>I had a very productive day, though much of it involved fiddly things, that don't necessarily show in the result.</p><p>I am disturbed to realise that we are nearing the end of the fourth week.  I have recognised that I pinned a lot of hopes on Hacker School. I had this idea that here I could do <em>everything I've always wanted to do</em>, to make up for ten years of stagnating ideas, while devoting my life to family. This is, of course, ridiculous, so I'm glad I am finally noticing that I did that.</p><p>No, I can't make up for anything. The past is the past, and it was well spent.  I would do it again.</p><p>In the present, I can still choose some things I like and do them.</p><div class="section" id="plan"><h3>Plan</h3><div class="section" id="protagonist"><h4>Protagonist</h4><ul class="simple"><li>Keep working toward the repair function, by adding functionality to <cite>mv</cite> and <cite>rm</cite> files and to manipulate the truenames directory.</li></ul></div><div class="section" id="machine-learning"><h4>Machine Learning</h4><ul class="simple"><li>Study neural net backpropagation, and talk about it with my ML partner.</li></ul></div><div class="section" id="blog"><h4>Blog</h4><ul class="simple"><li>Work on porting to Nikola.</li></ul></div></div><div class="section" id="actual"><h3>Actual</h3><div class="section" id="id1"><h4>Protagonist</h4><ul class="simple"><li>Implemented all the helper functions necessary for repair.</li><li>Put those into the command line interface.</li><li>Packaged it and <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/protagonist">put it on Pypi</a>!<ul><li>relearned how to use distutils, setup.py, and <a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/versioneer">versioneer</a>.</li><li>Got help chasing down a problem in my reStructedText that was preventing Pypi from rendering the README.</li></ul></li></ul></div><div class="section" id="id2"><h4>Machine Learning</h4><ul class="simple"><li>Studied the backpropagation equations, and thought about them a lot.</li><li>My ML partner is a mathematician, and she helped me recognise that the gradient computations are really not hard, even though there is a derivative involved, and a lot of fiddly indices.
