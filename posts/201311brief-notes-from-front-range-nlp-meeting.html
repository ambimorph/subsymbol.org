<html><body><p>Last night I led <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Front-Range-NLP-Natural-Language-Processing/events/146468962/">the discussion</a> on Noah Smith's paper <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0245">Adversarial Evaluation for Models of Natural Language</a>.  It was an interesting and animated discussion, and most of the valuable content was in the talking, but I'm posting my <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~amber/adversarial_slides.html">slides</a> for reference.  I also talked a bit about <a href="https://github.com/lamber/malaprop">Malaprop</a>, which builds an adversarial task along with a correction task.</p></body></html>
