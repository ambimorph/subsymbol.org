<html><body><div class="document" id="hacker-school-monday-june-23rd-2014">   <p>The annual North American conference for computational linguistics, which I have not missed since 2003, is convening in Baltimore as I write this. I was deeply disappointed about having to miss it, although, of course, by "having to", I mean I had something I wanted to do even more, and that's a great position to be in. Anyway, since it is so close to New York, and since the Sunday always consists of tutorials and the opening reception, I decided to go in just for that day.</p><p>The tutorial I chose was on a hot topic I've been following with interest: <a class="reference external" href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/files/6605/aclVectorTutorial.pdf">New Directions in Vector Space Models of Meaning</a>. It was very well done, if a little too much to absorb in one afternoon, but the slides are online, and I'd like to study it further.  I'm glad I attended.</p><p>The reception was a lot of fun, but I drank a fair share, and then had to catch my return bus to New York at 11:20 pm, arriving back home at 3.  So, I was a little bit tired yesterday, and not quite as functional as usual.</p><hr class="docutils"><p>I decided that it would be best to focus on only one thing, the Factor protagonist project, and I made some slow, but satisfying progress with that. I also watched some videos, part of one that was suggested in chat, and three that were watched as a group activity.</p><p>The last one we watched, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ahvzDzKdB0">Guy Steele's Growing a Language</a>, was both brilliant in its execution, and interesting in its message. I would not wish to spoil it, but what struck me as I listened, was how beautiful a fit for the concept he was demonstrating the language Factor is. Factor consists of vocabularies of <em>words</em> that are built on each other starting from a kernel of stack manipulations and some basic types. The approach to polymorphism seems to combine the best of object-oriented and functional wisdom. Extensibility is a core value of the language.</p><hr class="docutils"><p>I having been worrying about my progress, but I know that part of the slowness is just due to the learning curve of writing in a new language.</p><hr class="docutils"><div class="section" id="plan"><h3>Plan</h3><ul class="simple"><li>Factor / Protagonist<ul><li>Time to reassess, in light of what I learned about interfacing on Friday.  Possibly refactor for modularisation.</li><li>Make more progress on the core functionality.</li></ul></li></ul></div><div class="section" id="actual"><h3>Actual</h3><ul><li><p class="first">Factor / Protagonist</p><ul class="simple"><li>Made several small changes and did some refactoring:</li></ul><blockquote><ul class="simple"><li>the constructor I had added previously seemed to be getting in the way, rather then helping, so I took it out.</li><li>I found a shortcut word for something I had done repeatedly.  I expect to learn a lot more of this kind of optimisation.</li><li>Made a couple more symbols.  I'm still not sure if this is canonical.  I look forward to getting some review.</li><li>I fixed the function make-file-id so that it does something useful.  That thing is to hash the contents of the file and keep the file extension.</li></ul></blockquote></li><li><p class="first">Git</p><ul class="simple"><li>I went to most of Alan's tutorial on this (mistakenly thought the break was longer than it was, so I missed a bit in the middle). I got a better idea of the data structure that Git implemements, thus making everything more comprehensible.  Also learned the handy command <cite>git reflog</cite>, which gives a lot of information that will come in handy.</li></ul></li><li><p class="first">Videos</p><ul class="simple"><li>Watched the beginning of this video on reconciling the hard-line take on types from the programming languages academics with the real world of software engineering.  <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3GzCwoQfb4">Why JavaScript Programmers Hate You: an ode to dynamic languages</a>.</li><li>As a group, we watched:<ul><li><a class="reference external" href="http://vimeo.com/36579366">Brett Victor's Inventing on Priciple</a>, which I've seen before, but it was every bit as moving the second time.</li><li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat">Gary Bernhardt's short piece, WAT</a>, which was new to me and fun.</li><li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ahvzDzKdB0">Guy Steele's Growing a Language</a>, discussed above.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></div></div></body></html>
