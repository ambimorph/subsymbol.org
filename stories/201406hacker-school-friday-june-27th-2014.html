    <div class="document" id="hacker-school-friday-june-27th-2014">   <p>In Friday's job preparation workshop, we were writing a task that is interfaced through a web server. I have never written a web server; well, not since 2001 or so. It was good to get a basic idea of what tools to use to do this. Since I am working in Python, Tom recommended I use <a class="reference external" href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a>, because it is easy to <a class="reference external" href="http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/quickstart/">get started</a>. I think that was a good call. I didn't complete the actual project, because I spent all of my time learning how to use Flask, but that was a fine use of time, and I got far enough that I felt good about it. I now feel like I could build a basic web-based program without struggling overmuch on the server part of it. I at least know where to find the answers to likely problems.</p>
<p>The task reminded me of a personal project idea I have.  It is a web-based game with two players. The players will have a joint session, and they will both respond to a specific input. When both have committed a response, their responses are revealed and the next iteration starts. It seemed to me like Twisted Web would be a good way to do this.</p>
<p>Emboldened by my success with Flask, I started trying to learn Twisted Web. This was harder. I did several of the examples in a succinct series by <a class="reference external" href="http://as.ynchrono.us/">Jean Paul Calderone</a> called <a class="reference external" href="http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/10.1.0/web/howto/web-in-60/index.html">Twisted.Web In 60 Seconds</a>. The examples assume little outside context, and don't waste time. I thought they were well done.</p>
<p>However, there came a point where I seemed unable to generalise and get variations of the examples that I was thinking of working. I started feeling a characteristic physical discomfort that I experience only in the context of programming frustration. This is the first time I've felt it since I got here, even though I've had some other frustrations. It was a signal to stop and rethink.</p>
<p>After a break, I decided that this indicated that I didn't understand the underlying model well enough, and that I was seeking a solution with too shallow a commitment to learning. So I have committed to approaching the task as a <a class="reference external" href="http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/ch02.html#the_white_belt">Beginner</a>, and trying again. I plan to start with this more comprehensive document, <a class="reference external" href="http://twistedmatrix.com/documents/10.1.0/web/howto/using-twistedweb.html">Configuring and Using the Twisted.Web Server</a>.</p>
