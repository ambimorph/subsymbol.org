I am a computer scientist and software engineer with experience in natural language processing and machine learning.
I have an M.Sc. from the University of Toronto, where `I studied computational linguistics <http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~amber/>`_ with `Graeme Hirst <http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~gh/>`_.

My primary research interest is in the properties that emerge from the way information is structured. For example, different languages (formal or natural) vary in robustness to error, potential for ambiguity, expressiveness, and susceptibility to inference.

My skills:

* I am an excellent problem solver: I draw useful connections between different problems easily, making creative use of known solutions when possible. 
* I love coding: I use agile processes like test-driven development to assure quality and minimize debugging time.
* I work hard: I'm self-motivated, persistent, and meticulous.
* I work well with others: I like people.  I can listen to and learn from almost anyone, and I can also teach what I know.


For the last several years, most of my software experience has been in Python or C on Unix/Linux.  I'm happy learning new tools, too.


Please see my `CV <http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~amber/cv-website.pdf>`_ for more details.
