On Friday, I was suffering from two nights of reduced sleep.
Nonetheless, I came in eagerly for Job Prep Friday, because we were going to do one of my favourite things: whiteboarding problems.
When I say it is a favourite, 
I mean that I enjoy it immensely when I do it, though I do it rarely.

I worked with a couple other HaSchers on two problems.
Both of them were tree search problems, which I love.
I could tell I was out of practice, though.

In the afternoon, I studied the Twisted inotify code some more.
I was confused by a mistake in a docstring, and sent a pull request with a correction.
I used the inotify daemon to understand exactly what vi was doing that resulted in changed inodes.
There was still a behaviour I hadn't figured out by the end of the day, about why an inotify watcher on a directory reports changes to files using their pathnames, instead of reporting on the directory path name.

However, after writing and experimenting for a while, I realised I was overtired and not making progress, and I went home for an early night.
