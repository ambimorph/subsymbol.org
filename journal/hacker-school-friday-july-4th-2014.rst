Because of the holiday, there was no job preparation workshop.  I worked on Protagonist.
I fixed a setup.py mistake, and then I started working on converting my CLI to use the Python argparse module, instead of doing it "manually".
I want to take advantage of the `--help` an `--version` support.
It does require a little rewriting.

I decide to stop fasting for Ramadan.
This was a difficult decision, since I had made a public declaration of intent.
However, it had become too socially isolating, and ceased being worth the cost.
