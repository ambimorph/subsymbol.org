<html><body><p>I love the <a href="http://xmonad.org/">xmonad window manager</a>.   It's tiling, so it maximizes real estate, and it is driven by keys instead of the mouse.   It's written in Haskell -- enough said. </p><p>However, much as I love to tinker, I am reluctant to give up some things that "just work" when running Gnome and its successor, Unity.   So I run xmonad as the replacement window manager within Unity.   </p><p>I recently had the privilege of obtaining a new <a href="http://zareason.com">Zareason </a> UltraLap laptop (Zareason has an open bootloader, and ships with any of a variety of linuxes that also "just work"), and so I got to configure xmonad from scratch. </p><p>My modus operandus for this kind of thing is to see if someone else has solved it first, and my final (so-far) configuration came from merging a few sources. </p><p>First, I followed <a href="http://www.elonflegenheimer.com/2012/06/22/xmonad-in-ubuntu-12.04-with-unity-2d.html">the advice of Elon Flegenheimer</a>. Three of my config files came from him:   </p><h4>/usr/share/applications/xmonad.desktop</h4> <pre><code>[Desktop Entry]<br>Type=Application<br>Encoding=UTF-8<br>Name=Xmonad<br>Exec=xmonad<br>NoDisplay=true<br>X-GNOME-WMName=Xmonad<br>X-GNOME-Autostart-Phase=WindowManager<br>X-GNOME-Provides=windowmanager<br>X-GNOME-Autostart-Notify=true<br></code></pre> <h4>/usr/share/gnome-session/sessions/xmonad.session</h4> <pre><code>[GNOME Session]<br>Name=Xmonad Unity-2D Desktop<br>RequiredComponents=gnome-settings-daemon;<br>RequiredProviders=windowmanager;panel;<br>DefaultProvider-windowmanager=xmonad<br>DefaultProvider-panel=unity-2d-panel<br></code></pre> <h4>/usr/bin/gnome-session-xmonad</h4> <pre><code>#! /bin/sh<br>exec gnome-session --session xmonad "$@"<br></code></pre> <p>Then I based my /home/amber/.xmonad/xmonad.hs on <a href="https://gist.github.com/2551959">that of Arash Rouhani</a>, but I changed the Unity panel option to "doFloat" instead of doIgnore:  </p><h4>/home/amber/.xmonad/xmonad.hs</h4><pre><code>import XMonad<br>import XMonad.Util.Run<br>import XMonad.Util.EZConfig (additionalKeys)<br>import XMonad.Hooks.ManageDocks<br>import XMonad.Hooks.ICCCMFocus<br>import XMonad.Config.Gnome<br><br>myManageHook = composeAll (<br>  [ className =? "Unity-2d-panel" --&gt; doFloat<br>  , className =? "Unity-2d-launcher" --&gt; doFloat<br>  ])<br><br>main = <br>  xmonad $ gnomeConfig { modMask = mod4Mask<br>                       , manageHook = manageDocks  myManageHook  manageHook gnomeConfig <br>                       , layoutHook = avoidStruts $ layoutHook defaultConfig<br>                       , logHook = takeTopFocus<br>                       } `additionalKeys` [ ((mod4Mask, xK_d), spawn "dmenu_run -b")<br>                                          , ((mod4Mask, xK_Return), spawn "xfce4-terminal")<br>                                          ]<br></code></pre> <p>All the configurations I looked at had something in /usr/share/xsessions/xmonad-gnome-session.desktop, but my old laptop, on which I also run xmonad on Unity, does not, so I left that out. </p><p>Finally, there is <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/indicator-appmenu/+bug/734325">a problem with application menus</a> which I fixed per advice in that link by uninstalling indicator-appmenu. </p><p><a href="http://augix.com/img/Xmbindings.png">This keymap chart</a> shows most everything you need to know to get going with xmonad, and if you get stuck, try joining the irc channel #xmonad for help.</p></body></html>
