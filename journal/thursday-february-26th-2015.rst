My goal for Thursday was to read the rest of `Fragment Grammars: Exploring Computation and Reuse in Language <http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/44963>`_, which I did, minus the appendices.

I have written a blog post about my impressions so far.

.. Extra Notes:

   "Church is a stochastic version of the lambda calculus with a Scheme-like syntax built on a sampling semantics."
   
   "Stochastic functions are sometimes called a probabilistic kernels"

   We have probabilistic functions which serve as samplers.

   "There are various ways to define this distribution, but the simplest
   draws the possible RHSs of a production from a multinomial
   distribution."

   In this case *exchangeable* means that the order of the choice of
   partitioning doesn't affect the final probability. "A sequence of
   random variables is exchangeable if it has the same joint distribution
   under all permutations."
