Before I went to Mel Chua's workshop, I already knew that I felt strongly compelled to write about things that I'm learning, and that I find that pleasurable and rewarding.
However, I still harboured an attititude toward my writing as if it were an alternative to productivity.
That is, I would think things like "I could write about this thing I learned yesterday, or I could get more work done."
Phrased this way, writing felt self-indulgent, and not fully appropriate.
I felt guilty when I did it.

Now that I have come to understand the role of the active-reflective process in my own learning, I feel differently.
I have come to recognise that writing, for me, is not something I do *after* I learn, it is an integral part of the *process* of learning.
When I write, I intergate the components I gleaned from active exploration.
Therefore, it is not something I should put aside in favour of more "work".
It is a legitimate part of how I work.

Now that I see a piece of writing as a valid outcome in its own right, I have begun to want to incorporate more code in my writing.
I'm hoping this will have the effect of improving both my code and my writing.

-----

I haven't been writing my goals vs. actual for a awhile.
That information is useful feedback for me.

For example, on Monday I had the following goals:

* Get advice from Zach about adding code to my Polya's Urn post.
* Try to arrange to work with Jessica McKellar on writing a daemon using Twisted.
* Fix my website to display a list of my blog posts.
* Work on the Protagonist redesign.

What I actually did was:

* Get advice from Zach about adding code to my Polya's Urn post.
* Write a note to Jessica asking her if she would pair with me.
* Work on translating my Python program into javascript running within my blog post.

The latter is what I focused on for the remainder of the day.

I had a few interruptions, unfortunately: I was tired from staying up with Zooko and a visiting friend the night before, and I tried to treat my tiredness with food.
When that didn't work, I decided to take my nap at home to minimise the chance of being woken.
I came back refreshed, but then left an hour early to see off the visiting friend.
All in all, it was a productive day, and I'm pleased with the progress I made,
but I'm eager to get back into the sustained focus I had for the first several weeks here.
