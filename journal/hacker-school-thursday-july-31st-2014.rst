I am writing this journal entry about Thursday on Saturday afternoon, and finding that this is too long to properly remember what my goals and motivations were.
There are some things I know I did, because they had concrete results.

* I thought about inotify, and worked on presenting it, which I did during presentations.
  I started writing a blog post about it, too, and learned a few more things about the topic.

* I also expanded on my notes about Rich Hickey's talk on The Value of Values.

* I went to Michael Arntzenius's fun talk about the Curry-Howard correspondence.

This is perhaps the second time I have written with such a time lag, and it is amazing how much is lost.
