    <div class="document" id="hacker-school-thursday-june-26th-2014">   <p>On Thursday I gave my first presentation. This was great, because the desire to prepare increased my drive. Also, it was good practice.  I was ridiculously nervous.</p>
<p>I focused well during the early part of the day, and then did some review with Allison. Allison's feedback helped me understand which parts of the design required motivation, so I made that the focus of my presentation. I used this <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ambimorph/protagonist/blob/216a8fe6bfcd0048bcebc06cb93c30922ceb6be8/notes.rst">draft of notes</a> as make-shift slides. Unfortunately, I ran out of time, and didn't get to my demo at all! And even so, I didn't touch on everything in the design. Next time I'll book ten minutes, instead of seven.</p>
<p>Allison also helped me with my code. We found some places where I could run into unexpected errors, and she introduced me to <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#typecontextmanager">context managers</a> to handle those cases. Then she taught me how to write my own Exception class. Not only was that something I had been wanting to learn, it was a great improvement. I was sorry when the time was up.</p>

<ul class="simple"><li>Prepare for demo by finishing Boolean parsing.</li></ul>

<div class="section" id="actual">
<h4>Actual</h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Noticed a problem with names being not human readable when the files that match a tag are listed. To solve this, I made an index by storing the text of the pathnames in files named by the file id in a special directory called truenames. That solution is simpler than the others I considered, but has an undesirable consequence that I haven't fixed yet: it isn't updated when files in the original filesystem are moved. I'm beginning to wonder whether I'm going to need some garbage collection and repair routines, and how that would work.</li>
<li>Got feedback and code review from Allison, as described above.</li>
<li>Watched all the other fantastic presentations.</li>
<li>Fixed up some of the code based on the review session.</li>
