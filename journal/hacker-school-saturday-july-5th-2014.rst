On Saturday, I spent most of the day setting up what had been subsymbol.org into two separate sites: subsymbol.org has my themed posts, and isn't a blog, and blog.subsymbol.org has my logging.
I was really pleased about getting the sites configured, and I got a lot of help from a fellow Hacker Schooler.
Unfortunately, I had trouble with DNS, and blog.subsymbol.org is unreachable half of the time.
I still haven't fixed this.
