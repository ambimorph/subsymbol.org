I spent most of the weekend working on moving my blog off of Blogger.
I imported it to Nikola, a static site generator, and spent many hours figuring out how to configure it to have both a main blog for articles, and a journal blog in the background.
I also had to learn how to host it on GitHub.
I subsequently wrote two(!) posts about how that process went.

This blog moving used up time I had allocated to Dan Boneh's Coursera cryptography course, and so I still had that to do on Monday.
Not only that, but I spent more time trying to configure more blog things for the first few hours of the day.

I did finally get to the cryptography, though.
I'm pleased about that, because I love cryptography and coding theory, and have been wanting a refresher for a long time.
I'd like to turn some of my notes into a more formal post, but there was one small point that I'd like to mention.

The term *random variable* has long bothered me.
I don't find the *concept* confusing, but the name for it makes it hard for me to remember what it is.
A *random variable* is just a function that maps a set to a probability distribution.
A *randomised algorithm* is defined here in essentially the same way.

I guess I would prefer if the variable were abstracted away entirely.
